### Compiling Fortran code
one may use [f2py](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/) to bind fortran and python code for better performance. The variational_visco_hydrolysis material has some fortran routines in fortran as examples. f2py has some known limitations, such as no support for OOP in modern fortran. f2py works best in linux machines, but can be executed in windows as well if configured properly.
